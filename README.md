# Budget Tracker

Budget Tracker is a buggy budget tracker where players need to identify and fix bugs in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to come up with an optimal working application.

## Scenario

You’ve just been hired as the emergency tech lead at **DevBrothers**, a small startup that helps users manage their personal finances through a minimal, no-nonsense budget tracker app.

Last night, your company's lead developer rage-quit after a messy production deployment. The app is live, but riddled with bugs—and now the CEO is panicking. Users are already tweeting screenshots of broken graphs, disappearing expenses, and negative balances from nowhere.

Your mission:  
**Fix the app, stabilize the codebase, and get it back into a working state before the weekly stakeholder demo!** You have limited time, a bug-filled repo, and only your wits to guide you.
